### Hello everyone üëã
I'm Kevin, an enthusiastic individual with a strong passion for computer systems, particularly in the fields of distributed and cloud computing.

Currently, I am actively looking for opportunities in backend development, where I can contribute my skills to build scalable and reliable systems

## Current Focus üöÄ

### Cloud / Edge Computing  ‚òÅÔ∏è

Currently, I am actively involved in research at [Gatech EPL lab](https://epl.gatech.edu/), where we are dedicated to implementing an efficient approach for the FaaS (Function as a Service) platform to manage application state to minimize latency and IO overhead, thereby enhancing the overall performance.

Throughout this process, I have been studying distributed databases such as Redis, CouchDB, as well as cloud infrastructure technologies like Kubernetes (K8S) and OpenFaaS. Currently I am working on to setup [pheromum](https://github.com/KevinZTW/pheromone)  which is the implementation for the paper "Following the Data, Not the Function Rethinking Function Orchestration in Serverless Computing" on [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/) using Kubespray created K8S to benchmark the performance

### Distributed Backend Application üìê

In my previous workplace, we were gradually transitioning towards the microservices architecture. However I didn't have many opportunities to set up the complete CICD pipeline, manage K8S deployments, or design the whole system from scratch, among other things. As a result, I am now excitedly refactoring my project, [Taggy](https://github.com/KevinZTW/Taggy), with the following objectives:

1. Analyzing and constructing the "right" architecture for both single applications and microservices.
2. Exploring various techniques for data storage, telemetry, and information retrieval, including technologies like Kafka, Prometheus, Zipkin...etc.
3. Strengthening my skills with Docker, Golang, gRPC, Java, SpringBoot, MongoDB, and other relevant tools.
